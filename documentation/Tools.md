# Tools
## NodeJS
https://nodejs.org/ \
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. 
Node will help to run your webapp on your computer. It will act as the server for the HTML page, so your browser can load it. This will allow you to make changes in your Javascript code and see the result instantaneously.
### NPM (Node Package Manager)
NPM is a software package manager that is part of NodeJS. It allows you to use packages, that other developers made, so that you don't have to reinvent the wheel. There are a lot of packages out there that will make the development process easier, so you don't have to worry about a lot of details.
### Rollup 
https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/
Rollup is a module bundler for JavaScript which compiles small pieces of code into something larger and more complex, such as a library or application. We are not going to dive into Rollup. The Svelte default project template sets it up and we don't need to touch it. 
## Svelte
https://svelte.dev/ \
Svelte is a modern Javascript framework for developing web user interfaces.
A framework is a software package that helps you structure your code, so you can work faster and concentrate on one problem at a time. You need to follow certain conventions for your webapp to work. \
Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.
## Typescript
https://www.typescriptlang.org/
TypeScript is an open-source language which builds on JavaScript, one of the worldâ€™s most used tools, by adding static type definitions. \
Types provide a way to describe the shape of an object, providing better documentation, and allowing TypeScript to validate that your code is working correctly.
## Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a library for designing responsive websites. Sveltestrap makes it easy to use Bootstrap components and layouts in Svelte.
Bootstrap helps you to layout the elements that the browser displays and makes them look nice.
## Firebase
https://firebase.google.com/docs \
Firebase is a Google product and provides services like authentication, a datastore and also allows to host your webapp.
The most intriguing aspect is, that it is free to use in the beginning, until your website takes off and has a lot of traffic.
## VSCode
https://code.visualstudio.com/ \
VSCode is an editor for source code. It is free and is very extensible. Once you start using it, you will find and start extensions, that will make coding a lot easier.
## Github
Github is a website that will let you manage the project, it will be the central site for keeping documentation like this, source code and issues.
## Git
https://git-scm.com/ \
Git is a tool (used by Github) to maintain versions of your source code. This is very useful, especially when multiple people work on the same file. You do your changes locally and when you have a version you want to share, you can publish these changes to Github. Git will let you know when there are conlficts, when somebody else changed the same file and ask you to look at the change and merge your change with the other one.
